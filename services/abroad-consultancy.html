                    secondary vocational or business school. M-1 visa holders for technical and vocational programs are not permitted to work during the course of their studies.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-justify mb-2"> &emsp; The M-1 student visa applicants must have evidence that sufficient funds are immediately available to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of intended stay. M1 Student Visa Requirements Not everyone can apply and

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-justify mb-2"> &emsp; To be eligible to apply for the M1 visa, you need to apply and get admission at one of these institutions. After you get accepted, the school will register you into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and
                    give you a Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. English proficiency for International Students International students should have a good comprehension of the language. Their English level should be
                    high enough to allow them to understand and speak as required by educational institutions. They should understand lectures and be able to discuss class concepts.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-justify mb-2"> &emsp; English proficiency test as the TOEFL or the IELTS is required. Strong ties to your home residence/country With the M1 visa student are supposed to return back to your home country after you complete your education. That is why
                    you should prove your strong ties through property deeds, Bank details, residence country address, and family information. And must intend to return there on the completion of the course.

Your I-20 form contains an estimate of the expenses
                    for one year, so you should submit financial documents that prove you have that amount readily available. If your dependents are also joining you in the U.S, your financial situation should be even better, proving that you can also
